        <h2><strong>Our Story</strong></h2>
        <p style="border: 3px solid black;">The Story So Far is a five-piece American pop-punk band formed in Walnut Creek, California, in 2007. Their music blends catchy melodies with raw emotion and introspective lyrics, capturing the essence of youthful energy and angst. The band gained prominence in the underground punk scene with their debut full-length album, "Under Soil and Dirt" (2011), which received widespread praise due to the relatability and honesty of their lyrics.</p>

    <p style="border: 2px solid black;">The Story So Far have returned with their new album I Want To Disappear. Comprised of ten songs, it contains everything that’s brought them international acclaim and success since their inception. The current lineup features Parker Cannon (vocals), Kevin Geyer (lead guitar, keys), Ryan Torf (drums, rhythm guitar, and keys) and Will Levy (guitars). When speaking about the record, it’s hard for the band to pinpoint what inspired them in writing its songs, but for the four of them, there was a lot going on both personally and professionally in their lives. “We kind of grew out of our 20s between this record and last” says Torf. “Like a lot of people, you go through so many different things in life and you’re faced with new challenges. As a band, when you go through hardships you realize that some things are more important than music. These can and do take priority over playing, and that can feel divisive. It’s sometimes necessary though, to get to where you want to go.”</p>
